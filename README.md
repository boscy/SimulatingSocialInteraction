This NetLogo model was made as a part of my master's project.

In this project, a novel agent-based model was developed that aims to explore social interaction while it is constrained by visitor limitations (due to Dutch COVID measures). Specifically, the model aims to capture the interaction between the need for social contact and the support for the visitors measure. The model was developed using the HUMAT integrated framework, which offered a psychological and sociological foundation for the behaviour of the agents. 

A flowchart of the agents behaviour can be described by the following flowchart:
