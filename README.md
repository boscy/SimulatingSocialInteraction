This NetLogo model was made as a part of the master's project for the University of Groningen.

In this project, a novel agent-based model was developed that aims to explore social interaction while it is constrained by visitor limitations (due to Dutch COVID measures). Specifically, the model aims to capture the interaction between the need for social contact and the support for the visitors measure. The model was developed using the HUMAT integrated framework, which offered a psychological and sociological foundation for the behaviour of the agents. 

An overview of the agents' behaviour in the model can be described by the following flowchart:
